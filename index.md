ModSecurity is the standard open-source web application firewall (WAF) engine. Originally designed as a module for the Apache HTTP Server, it has evolved to provide HTTP request and response filtering capabilities across a number of different platforms including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS and Nginx. It is free software released under the Apache license 2.0 and remains the most widespread open source web application firewall engine used by businesses, government organizations, internet service providers and commercial WAF vendors alike.

The OWASP ModSecurity project provides the WAF engine. The engine is usually coupled with [OWASP CRS](https://coreruleset.org), the dominant WAF rule set, that brings protection against HTTP attacks.

### Road Map

The project, started in 2002, is being [transferred from Trustwave](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/trustwave-transfers-modsecurity-custodianship-to-the-open-worldwide-application-security-project/) [to OWASP](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/01/09/ModSecurity.html) in February 2024.

This will bring new life to ModSecurity and foster the creation of a development community around it.

It is one of the tasks of the new OWASP ModSecurity project to define a new roadmap.

### Communication

The website at [www.modsecurity.org](https://www.modsecurity.org) is in the hands of Trustwave. They plan to hand over the domain and the website in Summer 2024.

Until that happens, this page here will serve as intermediary website of the project.

Communication currently happens on the [#project-modsecurity](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C069PCXSW12) channel on the OWASP Slack (the channel is public and you can get an invitation to the Slack [here](https://owasp.org/slack/invite)).
