ModSecurity, sometimes called Modsec, is an open-source web application firewall (WAF). Originally designed as a module for the Apache HTTP Server, it has evolved to provide an array of Hypertext Transfer Protocol request and response filtering capabilities along with other security features across a number of different platforms including Apache HTTP Server,Microsoft IIS and Nginx.[4] It is free software released under the Apache license 2.0.

### Road Map
The project, started in 2002, is being transferred from Trustwave to OWASP in February 2024. It is one of the tasks of the new OWASP ModSecurity to define a new roadmap.
