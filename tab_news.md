## News From the OWASP ModSecurity Project

The following is a lose collection of news and status reports since OWASP took
over the project in Jan 2024.

### Status 2024-01-26

* Trustwave has transferred the ModSecurity repo to [https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity].
* The OWASP.org page at [https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity/] has been launched.
* OWASP has confirmed the new intermediary leadership team: Ervin Hegedüs, Marc Stern and Christian Folini. A portrait of them is on the owasp.org page of the project.
* The OWASP project committee has promoted OWASP ModSecurity to production level. While this is only an administrative status, there is symbolic value in the promotion.
* Trustwave has handed over the Twitter (X) account to OWASP. Ervin and Christian are delegates on the account.
* Trustwave did not release the previously announced security fix for ModSecurity3. Instead, they have asked OWASP ModSecurity execute the release with their assistance. We are now aiming for Jan 29 / 30. (this came a bit out of the blue for us)
* Contact with an additional ModSecurity integrator established.

### Status 2024-01-19

* Trustwave has shared the patch for the upcoming ModSecurity3 security release with Ervin. He tested it and it looks good. Expect a release on Monday.
* We got two additional endorsements. More are promised and I might ping again.
* There is a vendor who runs ModSec3 with Apache. My contact is currently out skiing but he promised to call me after his return.
* Contact with OWASP project committee established.
* Ivan Ristić shared the trademark identifier for ModSecurity with us. The trademark is currently with Trustwave and OWASP will make sure it's transferred too.
* We're still waiting to get the github repo to setup an initial OWASP project page via https://github.com/owasp/project-modsecurity (does not exist yet). We're getting there, I'm sure.
* We have started to collect a list of ModSecurity vendors and integrators. Two people volunteered to do more research. If you are also able to contribute, then please get in touch.

### Status 2024-01-12

* Talked to 7 people / industry leaders about an endorsement of OWASP ModSecurity
   * Ofer Shezaf promised to write an endorsement on LinkedIn
   * Ryan Barnett tells me to use his twitter statement
* Addressed community via existing communication channels:
   * Trustwave Spiderlabs Blog
   * OWASP Blog
   * ModSecurity Mailinglists
   * Various social media accounts on Twitter / X as well as LinkedIn
   * Christian Folini's ModSecurity / CRS newsletter sent to 1950 addresses
   * The only thing missing is a tweet by the @ModSecurity twitter account
* Lined up a first podcast appearance, but it will be February or March
* Contact with OWASP project committee initiated (we know the process to become a flagship project now), but no real feedback so far
* We're making progress with forming a temporary leader team for the project (The idea is to run with a self-appointed leader team during the incubation phase and then let the community form a production leader team in Spring)
* #project-modsecurity channel on Slack established
* Apparently development has not really started, but ModSec3 is planned to get a security release on Jan 22 (bookmark that date, it has at least a medium severity) and Trustwave has asked OWASP to cooperate on that release.
* Got in touch with a commercial integrator who runs their own libModSecurity3-Apache connector. The question will be if they would be interested to donate the code. Potentially a short cut to get a production hardened Apache connector.
